# Electronic Kiosk for Cinemas

This project aims to address the issue of long queues and waiting times at cinemas in Nicaragua by providing an affordable solution that can potentially scale in the future. The system is designed to be integrated with an ESP32 microcontroller, which utilizes an RFID sensor to read NFC cards. This enables the simulation of credit or debit card payments, enhancing the overall cinema experience. This project was developed by Josue Noel Lopez Guevara @tintays and Manuel Alejandro Juarez Juarez, both students from Universidad Tecnologica La Salle (La Salle Technological University), Leon, Nicaragua.

## Features

- **Queue Reduction:** The electronic kiosk helps minimize bottlenecks and waiting lines at cinemas, improving customer satisfaction.

- **Cost-Effective:** This solution is designed to be implemented at a low cost, making it accessible for cinemas of varying sizes.

- **Scalable:** The project is built with scalability in mind, allowing for potential expansion and integration with other systems.

## Components

- ESP32 Microcontroller
- RFID Sensor for NFC Card Reading

## How It Works

1. Customers approach the electronic kiosk.

2. They present their NFC cards, which are read by the RFID sensor.

3. The system simulates credit or debit card payment, reducing the need for physical cash transactions.

4. Tickets or entry confirmations are issued electronically.
